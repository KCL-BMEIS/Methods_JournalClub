# Methods Journal Club

The Methods JC is a journal club focused on the discussion of new methods proposed in computer vision and machine learning conferences and journals. The journal club aims to understand and discuss novel approaches proposed by the ML community, disregarding their results when out of the scope of medical imaging projects. Therefore, theoretical approaches from ML conferences without an obvious clinical impact are still interesting for the discussion. These approaches can potentially be adapted to be used in the medical imaging computing field.

The Methods JC can also be used to brainstorm new ideas or to find collaborations with researchers within the group, who can be interested or experienced in working on the proposed approach.

## Collaborating with the JC

The topics for discussion can be proposed in several ways:

1. By coming to a meeting and proposing a topic for the next session;
2. Using the slack channel: #methods_jc: *kcl-bmeis.slack.com/*
3. Raising an issue in the Github repository: https://github.com/KCL-BMEIS/Methods_JournalClub/
